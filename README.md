# Bit about me.

<div style="text-align: justify"> Lost all interest in my no-cs major (aerospace engineering). Journeyed through Data Analytics -> Data Science -> Data Engineering, going in circles. Lost in Data, almost a year went by (a story on its own).
Frustrated and lost in the desert of despair, I went back to my hometown (Kashmir). After 2 months of chilling, I got a job in amazon business as a remote customer service associate then got transfered to a NA region vertical. </div>

# Why are you all doing this?

<div style="text-align: justify"> This readme will act as reminder for me as well. After receiving my first ever salary, I realized now that I have money coming, I had to focus my free time and energy into really understanding software development from beginning.
In the past year or so of teaching myself data analytics I did whatever I pleased (had this "know-it-all" vibe) and I got easily fooled by the Illusions of Competence. I had done couple of courses (thought stacking on certifications is key because I had no background in cs), good dozen DA/DS projects (but used AI and didnt research problems properly -used an easy way out). As more time went by, I started thinking I was gonna be jobless forever, I will have to do manual labor. I was stuck in this weird self-doubt circle of despair (I knew I was a below average coder and didnt put work to improve) plus the job market was depressing, But Thank God, (Alhamdulillah) I got a job and it was remote. I Listened to alot bs on yt, got confused, misled, etc. but at the end of my journey I realized that I was lost in a path that led to a "goal" I didnt undertand (or know).
Coming back, I'm going to face my demons and acknowledge the fact that I am a below average coder and work on it -give it my all no matter how long it takes to my goal (which now is clear -> to get a SDE job). </div>
