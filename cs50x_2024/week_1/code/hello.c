// you can write comments in C using two forward slashes, or like following:
 
/*
 * "\n" is what we call a escape sequence. It is a special character that represents a new line
 * Note: if inside the quotes we put another backslash, it will be treated as a literal backslash
   (meaning it will be printed as a "\n" instead of a new line)
