- Source code ----> Compiler ----> machine code
    - source code = what we write
    - compiler  = sorta like a translator
    - machine code = what the computer undersatnds

- ran first code in cs50.dev (online vscode IDE for cs50) -> (make it clickable later)cs50x_2024\week_1\code\hello.c

- used ```code hello.c``` command to make the .c file , ```make hello``` to compile hello.c and used```./hello``` to run executable file made by running ```make``` (```./hello``` is like double clicking in a app in win/mac)

#### Understanding first line the code we wrote

i.e. #include <stdio.h>

**Q1. what is it like this? what does it mean?**
Ans. Its the syntax of C, you'll get used to it. every programming language has its own syntax. This line is  instructing the compiler to include the following .h file (a header file) in the source code. this header file has functions written in it by someone else that we can use in our own program with having to know how it was built. This concept is known as libraries in the programming world. Eg. Including stdio.h in our code, we will be able to use standard input output function "printf" etc.

- we also learned about visiting these **Documentations** (or Manual Pages), to understand more about these Libraries and how to use them.
