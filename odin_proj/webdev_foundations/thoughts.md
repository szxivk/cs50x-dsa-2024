## Prerequisites
- `win-key + shift + s` on windows opens screenshot tool / snip too, lol.
- How the internet works? Its [ans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work).
- Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.
  
  ![Clients and servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works/simple-client-server.png)
- world wide web and email are services on top of internet.
-  Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the internet) with the service (e.g., the web)
- [Glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary) - web comes with a lot of jargon.
- difference between web page, website, web server, and search engine?
  - web page: A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages."
  - website: A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site."
  - web server: A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.
  - search engine: A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo.
  - Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine)
  - Web browser: is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages
- [Reminder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works#clients_and_servers): Analogy for client-server interaction.
